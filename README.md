<h1>School Database</h1>
<p>This is a mini database that I created for my school that uses SQLite.</p>
<p>I did this project to learn about the basics of databases and how to combine Database languages with programming languages.</p>
<p>I followed <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayp3tHEkRc0">this tutorial</a> by Tim Corey for learning how to work with databases using c# and some W3Schools tutorials and documentation. Of course I used the c# documentation as well.</p>
